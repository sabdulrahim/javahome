Setting the Time for Your Linux Instance:
========================================
A consistent and accurate time reference is crucial for many server tasks and processes.
Amazon provides the Amazon Time Sync Service, which you can access from your instance. 
deliver accurate current time readings of the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) global standard through Network Time Protocol (NTP).
The Amazon Time Sync Service automatically smooths any leap seconds that are added to UTC


Configuring the Amazon Time Sync Service:
=========================================
The Amazon Time Sync Service is available through NTP at the 169.254.169.123 IP address for any instance running in a VPC. Your instance does not require access to the internet, and you do not have to configure your security group rules or your network ACL rules to allow access. Use the following procedures to configure the Amazon Time Sync Service on your instance using the chrony client.

Note
Support for the Amazon Time Sync Service on C5 and M5 instances is coming soon. When available, the default chrony configuration on these instance types will automatically start using the 169.254.169.123 time source. Until then, ensure that your instance's security group rules allow outbound UDP traffic on port 123 (NTP).

Important
On Amazon Linux, the default chrony configuration is already set up to use the Amazon Time Sync Service IP address. For Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), CentOS, Fedora, and Ubuntu distributions, you must edit the chrony configuration file to add a server entry for the Amazon Time Sync Service.


sudo yum erase ntp* -y
sudo yum install chrony -y
sudo cat /etc/chrony.conf
sudo service chronyd start
sudo chkconfig chrony on
chronyc sources -v

Changing the Time Zone:
=======================
If you wish to change the time on an instance to the localtime or another time zone 

Amazon Linux instances are set to the UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) time zone by default, but you may wish to change the time on an instance to the local time or to another time zone in your network.

These procedures are intended for use with Amazon Linux.
sudo vi /etc/sysconfig/clock 
modify zone value only
Ex
Zone="America/Los_Angeles" to Zone="America/New_York" 

sudo ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/America/Los_Angeles /etc/localtime
sudo reboot
